## Architecture

ACS is the communications subsystem of the larger NEURO-DIV systematic architecture. It coordinates agent-to-agent handoffs, shared operational state, narrative and cognitive feedback routing, context continuity, verification, and common tool access across ecosystem layers. The repository is its portable discovery layer, the Google Doc is its canonical standing brief, and Zapier MCP is its preferred common action layer.

ACS is not the whole NEURO-DIV framework. The Core Foundation Document is the current parent spine, but it is incomplete and contains transcription contamination. A separate architecture reconstruction must compare the surviving versions, identify missing components, resolve contradictions, and integrate ACS at every applicable layer.

The current theory-to-system crosswalk is documented in [theory-branch-integration.md](theory-branch-integration.md). Its controlling chain is: WIPED behavioral state -> adaptive branch parameters -> branch-structured reasoning -> CBAL identity and lineage -> ACS routing and synchronization -> distributed-worker execution -> verification, convergence, consolidation, and garbage collection. WIPED is a provisional behavioral-adaptation model, not the whole NEURO-DIV theory or a clinically validated universal equation.

QTU is the mandatory epistemic execution gate for state-changing directives within QTU scope. The normalized score is `U_norm = A_OOD * A_CF * (L_min / L(M))`. ACS may route an in-scope directive into execution only when its one-sided 90% lower confidence bound satisfies `QTU-LCB90 >= 0.90`. A point estimate alone is insufficient; missing, stale, or non-reproducible evidence blocks in-scope execution. The canonical source is [A Quantitative Theory of Understanding rev1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MOxQjpZ59JzOOZs9EsFEuq49DKN3TkjW).

The mandatory [QTU Administrative and Logistical Safe Harbor](qtu-administrative-logistical-safe-harbor.md) is governed by project/work-product effect, not application or environment. An action affecting a project/work-product or anything used to define, produce, document, govern, configure, test, verify, reproduce, approve, publish, or communicate it remains within QTU. Otherwise, a routine, non-substantive, precisely bounded, readily reversible administrative or logistical action may qualify only when every safe-harbor condition and independent hard gate passes. Desktop/browser settings are examples, not the definition. Its examples are illustrative and do not represent all possible activities, settings, purposes, dependencies, or effects; uncertainty returns the action to QTU.

The mandatory [Integrity, Materiality, Evidence, and Commitment Control](integrity-materiality-control.md) governs material claims and completion assertions. It is PCAOB-aligned, not a claim of PCAOB compliance. It requires fact/inference separation, supporting and contradictory evidence, proportional materiality routing, capability and counterpart awareness, durable commitment records, and read-back before claims of memory, synchronization, completion, or remediation. The QTU paper defines the understanding functional; the normalized score, confidence-bound method, and 0.90 threshold are ACS operational extensions.

The mandatory [Maximal Progression and User-Attention Escalation Control](maximal-progression-user-attention-control.md) keeps task ownership with the agent. Before escalating, agents must complete all safe authorized preparation, verify the blocker, reduce the user's role to one irreducible approval or credential step, and present one prominent `🚨 ACTION REQUIRED FROM YOU` block with exact steps, completed work, consequences, and the agent-owned resume action. After the user acts, the agent resumes automatically and verifies closure; the user is not required to remember to request continuation.

The mandatory [Automation Cost, Cadence, and Proportionality Control](automation-cost-cadence-proportionality-control.md) governs recurring, scheduled, polling, monitoring, retry, and background work. It requires a whole-window cost-versus-importance preflight; event-driven and least-cost adequate execution; bounded runs, expiry, cost, model/reasoning level, task creation, and tripwires; and automatic pause after two consecutive system errors, three consecutive no-op runs, or a user cost complaint. Unknown, unbounded, or disproportionate cost blocks activation.

The native reminder and notification routing rule requires ordinary one-time or recurring reminders to use the cheapest adequate device-native or product-native mechanism that invokes no AI model, including Apple Reminders, Calendar reminders, local operating-system notifications, or the target product's native scheduler. Never create a Codex or other LLM automation merely to wait, poll, check time, or deliver a reminder. Codex automation is reserved for execution-time work that genuinely requires reasoning or tool actions and still must pass the automation cost control. Native recurring reminders are preferred over recurring agent runs. If native cross-device delivery is unavailable, agents must disclose the reachability limitation and use the least-cost already-authorized reachable native channel rather than silently substituting an expensive Codex automation. Codex native notifications are reserved for meaningful Codex completion or a genuine user-only blocker, while task ownership remains with the agent.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` | User-level connection | Operational |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.mcp.json` | Project and user configuration | Operational; project config may require local approval/authentication |
| GitHub Copilot / VS Code | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `AGENTS.md` | `.vscode/mcp.json` | Zapier MCP authenticated and running; Copilot GitHub sign-in still required |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md` | Project endpoint documented | Individual-account onboarding blocked by Google migration notice |
| Antigravity | `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md` | Configured and OAuth-authenticated | Live Zapier calls fail on unauthorized MCP notification traffic |
| Perplexity | Persistent custom instructions | No Zapier/custom MCP exposed on current Free account | Shared context verified; live common action layer unavailable |
| Other LLMs | `AGENTS.md`, this snapshot, JSON manifest | Use the documented HTTP endpoint if supported | Client-dependent |

## Codex project hooks

Codex has a narrow project-local hook layer for this repository. The hook configuration lives at `.codex/hooks.json` and calls `.codex/hooks/ndv_context_hook.py` for `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and `PostCompact`.

The hook is intentionally read-only. When the active `cwd` is inside `/Users/dinamargelovich/Documents/General`, it emits a compact context reminder to read the repository snapshot and controls before material claims or state-changing work unless canonical Drive access has been directly verified. Outside this workspace it emits nothing. It does not log prompts, write to Drive, block tools, communicate externally, or handle credentials.

Directive `NDV-HOOKS-2026-07-19-A` authorized this reversible hook installation and synchronization. The dry-run protocol passed 60 of 60 OOD context-routing cases and 60 of 60 counterfactual/non-leakage cases. Using independent uniform `Beta(1,1)` component priors, exact one-sided 90% component lower credible bounds of `0.962956`, and `L_min/L = 1.0`, the conservative `QTU-LCB90` is `0.927285`. This is authorization for the narrow hook layer only, not evidence of production effectiveness.

## Synchronization rule

The canonical brief is authoritative. After a verified state change, update it first when possible, then update this snapshot and `agent-resources.json` in the same Git change. If the canonical brief is inaccessible, label repository changes as pending reconciliation.
